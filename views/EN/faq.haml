    Q:

    Why the change from the old RDT setup?
  %br
  %strong
    A:
  With the separation of the IQA into new national leagues, the RDT would have remained a part of a national body, specifically, the USQ. This would mean that the new leagues would not have access to the collective experience, which the IRDP felt would hinder the continued growth of the sport. For that reason, we believe that it is better for the game, and community as a whole, to work specifically as an independent organization whose sole aim is to better the quality of referees worldwide.

    What does this change for me?
  %br
  %strong
    A:
  For leagues that contract the IRDP, the changes will be marginal. This site is an example of the changes you can expect: a more streamlined, efficient, and simple approach to delivering information to those who are interested in our services. Anyone that is involved in a league that uses the IRDP and our resources should expect the same services that were present under the IQA RDT.

    Q:
  %i
    My league hasn’t hired you; can I still become an IRDP certified referee?
  %br
  %strong
    A:
  Yes, and you are encouraged to do so. Please note, however, that if your league does not contract us, your certification as an IRDP referee will hold no bearing on the membership requirements for your league. If you want to become a certified IRDP Head Referee, there will be a fee associated with that process.

          Referee Training Coordinators
        These members have been noted to have a high level of refereeing and offer constructive criticism for other referees. Their focus is to certify and train new referees to become stronger representatives of the IRDP.

    Q:
  %i
    How exactly is my head ref fee used?
  %br
  %strong
    A:
  Even though a lot of candidates look great on paper, a large part of head reffing is control of the pitch. In order to ensure refs are talented on the field, we cover the cost of transport for our field testers around the world to affirm that only the most talented HR candidates are certified. Additionally, your fee powers our website and online testing resources (classmarker). The IRDP makes no profit and all of your money is used to better your reffing experience. You can read more about it on our

  Never fear! Sometimes a packet gets dropped. If your paypal purchase went through (you saw the "Payment Completed" page and/or got the confirmation email), then you'll definintely get site access, don't you worry. First try 
  %a{href: '/logout'}<
    logging out
  and back in to see if that fixes it. If that doesn't work, email the 
  %a{href: 'mailto:david@relateiq.com'}<
    webmaster

    Q:
  %i
    How is testing different from the last season with the IQA?
  %br
  %strong
    A:
  The IRDP has completely revamped the internal structure of the written tests. The new system more effectively tests candidates on their knowledge of specific rules, and follows a question format that will allow for easier understanding. In addition, the field test has been streamlined, as well as a sixth section that has been added to test a candidate's ability to make the correct calls in a game. Additionally, it's all offered through one convenient, automated site (this one).
